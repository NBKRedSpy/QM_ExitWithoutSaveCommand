# Quasimorph Exit Without Save Command

![thumbnail icon](media/thumbnail.png)

* Adds a `save` command to save at any time.
* Adds an `exit-no-save` to exit the current game without saving.

This allows developers to test the same scenario without restarting the game.
For example, killing monsters, spawning items in space, etc.

# Usage
Open the game console with the backtick key, and then type one of the commands and enter.
