# Quasimorph Exit Without Save Command

![thumbnail icon](media/thumbnail.png)

A console command to exit a dungeon (combat) without saving. 

This allows developers to test the same scenario without restarting the game.

For example, killing monsters or taking damage.

# Usage
Install the Quasimorph developer console mod.

When in the dungeon mode (combat), open the console and type exit-no-save and press enter.

The game will now exit back to the main menu without changing the save.
