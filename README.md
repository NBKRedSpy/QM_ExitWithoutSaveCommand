# Quasimorph Exit Without Save Command

![thumbnail icon](media/thumbnail.png)

A console command to exit the game that is loaded without saving.

This allows developers to test the same scenario without restarting the game.

For example, killing monsters, spawning items in space, etc.

# Usage
Install the Quasimorph developer console mod.

When a game is loaded, open the console and type exit-no-save and press enter.

The game will now exit back to the main menu without changing the save.
