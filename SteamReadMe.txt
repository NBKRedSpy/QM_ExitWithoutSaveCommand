[h1]Quasimorph Exit Without Save Command[/h1]


A console command to exit a dungeon (combat) without saving.

This allows developers to test the same scenario without restarting the game.

For example, killing monsters or taking damage.

[h1]Usage[/h1]

Install the Quasimorph developer console mod.

When in the dungeon mode (combat), open the console and type exit-no-save and press enter.

The game will now exit back to the main menu without changing the save.
