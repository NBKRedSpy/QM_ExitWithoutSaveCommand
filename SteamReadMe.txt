[h1]Quasimorph Exit Without Save Command[/h1]

[list]
[*]Adds a [i]save[/i] command to save at any time.
[*]Adds an [i]exit-no-save[/i] to exit the current game without saving.

This allows developers to test the same scenario without restarting the game.
For example, killing monsters, spawning items in space, etc.

[h1]Usage[/h1]

Open the game console with the backtick key, and then type one of the commands and enter.
